# EEEEEEEE-Sim
 A simulator for the E8 Architecture I created, with a specification-type document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZuOjC9-vyo861tgI32147iGDFwaUJDAP9w7fYyiy7tY/edit?usp=sharing)

In short, E8 is a small ISA with 16 bit fixed-length instructions and 4 8-bit registers. It was originally designed to be what would be needed to have a suitably functional but simple computer in Minecraft, and I'm working with it elsewhere, such as here, in its full capacity in terms of amount of RAM and ROM
